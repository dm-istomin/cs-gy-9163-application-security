# CS-GY 9163: Application Security

This is a repository for my code from the class, Summer 2019.

## Spellchecker

A simple command-line program to spell check a text file. Should work with Python 2 or Python 3.

Usage is simple: run the program with an input file name and an output file name.
A simple input file with typos is included in this repo.

```bash
python spellchecker.py input.txt output.txt

# Produces a file called output.txt with the spelling errors corrected.
```
